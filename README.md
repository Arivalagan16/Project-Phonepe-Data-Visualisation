## Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration: A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly

## Introduction
    This project involves cloning the PhonePe Pulse dataset using Git
    then transforming the data into dataframe by using Pandas.
    Transformed data is subsequently stored in a SQL database with help of SQL conncetor and SQL-Alchemy engine.
    Additionally, an interactive dashboard is developed with Streamlit and Plotly, featuring geoplots and other visualization elements for enhanced data exploration and insights.

## Overview

## Data Extraction:
    the data is extracted from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository and cloned to the local environment, ensuring access to the latest dataset for analysis.

## Data Transformation:
    The raw data undergoes transformation, including cleaning, formatting, and structuring in dataframe format using pandas

## Database Integration:
    Mysql connector used for connection between Python and MySQL database with XAMPP, enabling data transfer. SQLAlchemy's engine facilitates efficient data insertion and querying, simplifying database interactions for Python.

## Data Visualization And Analysis:
    With the assistance of Streamlit and Plotly, a dashboard and charts are created, offering geospatial visualizations and top insights. This setup empowers users to explore and reveal trends within the dataset, facilitating insightful analysis.

## GEO visualization:
    The geo visualization showcases transaction amounts and counts across Indian states, plotted on a map. Additionally, it incorporates registered user counts, providing a state-wise overview on the map

## TOP Insights:
    Top insights encompass various key findings derived from the data, visualized through charts showcasing the most significant trends.
